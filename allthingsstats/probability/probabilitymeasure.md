# Laws of Probability

There are three main axioms in probability determined by A. N. Kolmogorov and hence called Kolmogorov's axioms. Given a **probability measure space** $(\Omega, \cv{F}, \pr)$:

1. $\pr(\Omega) = 1$
2. $\pr(A) \geq 0$ for all $A \in \cv{F}$
3. For disjoint sequence $A\_1,...,A\_n,...\in\cv{F}$, $\pr(\cup A\_i) = \sum \pr(A_i)$ (countable additivity)

We can derive some critical results on continuity and sub-additivity of the probability measure function $\pr: \cv{F}\to [0,1]$ from these axioms.

## Continuity

Continuity of probability refers to the idea that $\lim \pr(A\_n) = \pr(\lim A\_n)$ provided a limit exists. It turns out we can do this if $A\_n$ is a nested decreasing or increasing sequence. If a) $A_1\subseteq...\subseteq A_n \subseteq ...$, or if b) $$A_1\supseteq...\supseteq A_n \supseteq ...$$ then:

$$\lim_{n\to\infty} \pr(A_n) = \pr\left(\lim_{n\to\infty} A_n\right)$$ 

_Proof_ : The sets $A\_n$ are increasing so for any $A\_n \cap A\_{n+1} = A\_n$. Thus define $B\_{n} = A\_{n}\setminus A\_{n-1}$ where we let $A\_0 = \nul$. Here $B\_n$ becomes a sequence of disjoint sets with $\cup\_{n=1}^N B\_n = \cup\_{n=1}^N A\_n = A\_N$ for all $N$. Therefore,

$$\pr\left(\bigcup_{n \geq 1} A_n \right) = \pr\left(\cup_{n\geq 1} B_n \right) = \lim_{N\to\infty} \sum_{n=1}^N \pr(B_n) = \lim_{N\to\infty} \pr(A_N)$$ 

Note here we treat $\lim A\_n = \cup A\_n$ since $A\_n \subseteq A\_{n+1}$. 

The case for when $A\_n \supseteq A\_{n+1}$ works in the same way, and it is critical that we assume $\pr(\Omega) = 1$ to maintain that $\pr(\cdot)$ is a finite measure.

## Sub-Additivity

Sub-additivity refers to the idea that if $A\_1,...,A\_n,...$ is a countable sequence of events that need not be disjoint, then

$$\pr\left(\bigcup_{i\geq 1}A_i\right) \leq \sum_{i\geq1} \pr(A_i)$$

_Proof_ : Let $B\_1 = A\_1$, and $B_n = A\_n\setminus \cup\_{k < n} A\_k$. Then the sequence of sets $B\_n$ are mutually disjoint. This gives:

$$\bigcup_{n\geq 1} A_n = \bigcup_{n\geq 1} B_n$$

and we know $\pr(\cup\_{n\geq 1} A_n) = \pr(\cup\_{n\geq 1} B_n) = \sum \pr(B\_n)$ by Kolmogorov's axioms. Now:

$$\pr(B_n) = \pr(A_n\setminus \cup_{k < n} A_k) \leq \pr(A_n)$$

So putting it all together $\pr(\cup\_{n\geq 1} A_n) = \pr(\cup\_{n\geq 1} B_n) = \sum \pr(B\_n) \leq \sum \pr(A\_n)$. Thus proves the sub-additivity of the probability measure. $\tag*{∎}$

**Exercise** (Finite additivity): Prove that the probability measure is finitely additive, i.e. for $(\Omega, \cv{F}, \pr)$, if $A\_1,...,A\_N \in \cv{F}$ disjoint then $\pr(\cup\_{i=1}^N A\_i) = \sum\_{i=1}^N \pr(A\_i)$

**Exercise**: Suppose that we did not know about countable additivity, but we knew about finite additivity and countable sub-additivity. Prove that countable additivity still holds.

**Exercise**: Consider a sequence of events $A\_1,...,A\_n,... \in \cv{F}$ in probability space $(\Omega, \cv{F}, \pr)$. If for any pair of events $\pr(A\_k \cap A\_j) = 0$ then show $\pr(\cup A\_n) = \sum\_{n=1}^\infty \pr(A\_n)$. Be careful, $\pr(A\_k \cap A\_j) = 0$ does not necessarily imply $A\_k \cap A\_j = \nul$. (Hint: consider the finite case of $n$ events, then send $n$ to $\infty$.)

## Some Terminology

Before we go on to talking about measures of limiting events, we should mention some terminology used when talking about probability and measures. Probability is a measure of sets in the outcome space and $\pr: \cv{F} \to [0,1]$. Suppose we have a set $A \in \cv{F}$ and $A \subseteq \Omega$ but $\pr(A) = 1$, then we say $A$ is an event that happens almost always. Likewise, if $\pr(A)= 0$ we say that $A$ happens almost never, or that $A^C$ happens almost always.

Likewise, if we consider a finite measure $\mu: \cv{F} \to [0,K]$, and for some set $A \in \cv{F}$, $\mu(A) = K$ then we say $A$ happens almost everywhere with respect to $\mu(\cdot)$. It is often written in shorthand where we say $A$ (a.e. $\mu$) to mean the same thing.

**Exercise**: Prove a countable set i.e. $\\{\mathbb{Q}\cap[0,1]\\}$ has measure 0 where $\Omega = [0,1]$ with the Lebesgue measure $\lambda$ defined upon the measurable space. (Hint: Cover the $n$-th rational number with an interval of length $\frac{\eps}{2^{n+1}}$ centered at the rational number. As there are countably many, sum all the interval covers.) 

# Limit Inferior and Limit Superior of Events

The basic laws of probability have been built. There is nothing particularly interesting regarding basic probability laws, but we have now defined it as a measure and showed some basic properties. In the end, we hope to learn something about limiting behavior of these probability measures. Limits not not always defined, but from analysis, we know that $\limsup$ and $\liminf$ are always defined and when they are equivalent, then the limit exists and is defined.

From analysis, we know that $\limsup a\_n$ is essentially the largest completion value attainable occuring infinitely many times with respect to $n$, and $\limsup a\_n$ is the lowest completion value attainable. So if we have $a\_n := \sin \pi n$, then $\liminf a\_n = -1$ and $\limsup a\_n = 1$. The $\inf$ and $\sup$ portions are only meaningful since a partial ordering is defined on the real numbers. Likewise in sets, the partial ordering is $\subseteq$. We are ready to define $\liminf$ and $\limsup$ for sets now. Given a sequence of sets $A\_n$:

$$\liminf_{n\to\infty} A_n = \bigcup_{N\geq 1} \bigcap_{n > N} A_n$$

$$\limsup_{n\to\infty} A_n = \bigcap_{N\geq 1} \bigcup_{n > N} A_n$$ 

It is important to digest what exactly this means, especially if this is the first time seeing this type of set notation. 

## Limit Inferior

An event $\omega$ is in $\liminf A\_n$ if and only if it is in $\cup\_{N\geq 1} \cap\_{n > N} A\_n$. This means, there exists some $N$, such that we can find $\omega$ in _all_ $A\_n$ for any $n$ larger than $N$. This means $\omega$ is in $A\_n$ eventually, and that there are only finitely many $A_n$'s that do not contain $\omega$. To contexualize, I can pick an $N$ such that if this chosen $N$ is large enough, I can guarantee that $\omega$ is in $A\_n$ for all indices $n$ greater than the picked $N$.

## Limit Superior

An event $\omega$ is in $\limsup A\_n$ if and only if it is in $\cap\_{N\geq 1} \cup\_{n > N} A\_n$. This means, for all $N$, we can find $\omega$ in some $A\_n$ for any $n$ larger than $N$. To contexualize, if you give me any number $N$, I can still find at least one $A\_n$ that contains $\omega$ where the index $n$ is larger than the provided $N$. This concept is known as _infinitely often_ and is typically abbreviated as i.o. 

**Exercise**: Consider a sequence of numbers $a\_n$ where $a\_n := -1$  when $n$ is even and $a\_n := 1$ when $n$ is odd. Is $a_n$ odd eventually, or is it odd infinitely often? Is $a_n$ even eventually or odd infinitely often?

**Exercise**: Let $A\_n := [0, 1/n]$ be a set of numbers indexed by $n$. Describe what is in the set $\cup\_{N\geq 1} \cap\_{n> N} A\_n$ and what is in $\cap\_{N\geq 1} \cup\_{n> N} A\_n$?

**Exercise**: Let $A\_n := [0,1/3)$, for $n$ mod $3 = 0$, $A\_n := [1/3, 2/3)$ for $n$ mod $3 = 1$ and $A\_n := [2/3, 1)$ for $n$ mod $3 = 2$. What is in $\liminf A\_n$ and what is in $\limsup A\_n$?

**Exercise**: Prove $\liminf A\_n \subseteq \limsup A\_n$. 

**Exercise**: Prove $(\limsup A\_n)^C = (\liminf A\_n^C)$. (Hint: Use De Morgan's laws.)

Note: the last two exercises are important properties of $\liminf$ and $\limsup$ of sets. Make sure you understand them.

## Baby "Fatou"

For those exposed to some measure theory, [Fatou's lemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatou%27s_lemma) may look familiar. Here, we present a relation similar to Fatou's lemma which we coin as Baby "Fatou."

$$\pr\left(\liminf_{n\to\infty} A_n\right) \leq \liminf_{n\to\infty} \pr(A_n) \leq \limsup_{n\to\infty} \pr(A_n) \leq \pr\left(\limsup_{n\to\infty} A_n\right)$$ 


We prove the first $\leq$. The second $\leq$ follows by definition from analysis.

_Proof_ : Using the definition of $\liminf$:

$$\pr\left(\liminf_{n\to\infty} A_n\right) = \pr\left(\bigcup_{N \geq 1} \bigcap_{n > N} A_n\right)$$

Note that $\cap\_{n>N} A\_n$ is an increasing sequence of sets as $N$ gets larger (less intersections make resulting sets less restrictive). Thus by continuity of probability,

$$\pr\left(\bigcup_{N \geq 1} \bigcap_{n > N} A_n\right) = \lim_{N\to\infty} \pr\left(\bigcap_{n > N} A_n\right)$$

Since $\cap\_{n > N} A\_n \subseteq A_{N+1}$ then $\pr(\cap\_{n>N} A\_n) \leq \pr(A\_{N+1})$. Therefore,

$$\liminf_{n\to\infty} \pr(\cap_{n>N} A_n) \leq \liminf_{N\to\infty} \pr(A\_{N+1})$$

Putting the above two equations together:

$$\pr\left(\bigcup_{N \geq 1} \bigcap_{n > N} A_n\right) \leq \liminf_{N\to\infty} \pr(A_{N+1})$$

which can be rewritten as:

$$\pr\left(\liminf_{n\to\infty} A_n\right) \leq \liminf_{n\to\infty} \pr(A_n)$$ 

This demonstrates the leftmost inequality and the second inequality follows from basic analysis. $\tag*{∎}$ 

**Exercise**: Prove the $\limsup$ relation, (right-most inequality)

# Borel-Cantelli Lemmas

Now that we have discussed the $\limsup$ and $\liminf$ procedures on events, we can now talk about how to measure these limiting events. Later on, we will see that limiting procedures in general, will always have probability 0 or 1 provided some technical details. For now, we focus on some conditions regarding the measure of these limiting procedures. The rules governing the probability of these limiting procedures are called the Borel-Cantelli lemmas. 

## First Borel-Cantelli Lemma:

> Let $A\_1,...,A\_n,...$ is a sequence of events indexed by $n$. 

$$\sum_{i=1}^\infty \pr(A_n) < \infty \implies \pr\left(\limsup_{n\to\infty} A_n\right) = 0$$

This tells use that if the sum of the probabilities over $n$ converges quick enough to 0, then $A_n$ happens infinitely often (w.r.t. n) almost never (almost never means with measure 0, or with probability 0).

_Proof_ : Let $A\_1,...,A\_n,...$ be a sequence of events such that the sum of the probability is convergent. Then,

$$\pr\left(\bigcap_{N \geq 1} \bigcup_{n\geq N} A_n\right) = \lim_{N\to\infty}\sum_{N=1}^\infty \pr\left(\bigcup_{n \geq N} A_n\right) \leq \lim_{N\to\infty} \sum_{n=N}^\infty \pr\left(A_N\right) = 0$$ 

The last equality is by the Cauchy criteria of tail sums of convergent sequences from analysis. Since $\pr(\limsup A\_n) \leq 0$ then it must be 0 by non-negativity of probability. $\tag*{∎}$ 

For the next lemma, we need to define **independence** of events. Two sets are independent if $\pr(A\_j \cap A\_k) = \pr(A\_j)\pr(A\_k)$. We will discuss more about independence later but this definition is sufficient to understand the second Borel-Cantelli lemma.

## Second Borel-Cantelli Lemma:

> Let $A\_1,...,A\_n,...$ is a sequence of jointly independent events indexed by $n$. 

$$\sum_{i=1}^\infty \pr(A_n) = \infty \implies \pr\left(\limsup_{n\to\infty} A_n\right) = 1$$

_Proof_ : Let $A\_1,...,A\_n,...$ be a sequence of independent events such that the sum of the probability is infinite. Then,

$$\pr\left(\bigcap_{N \geq 1} \bigcup_{n\geq N} A_n\right) = 1 - \pr\left(\bigcup_{N \geq 1} \bigcap_{n\geq N} A_n^C\right) = 1 - \lim_{N\to\infty} \pr\left(\bigcap_{n\geq N} A_n^C\right)$$

The above is by the continuity of probability. Then by independence,

$$1-\lim_{N\to\infty} \pr\left(\bigcap_{n\geq N} A_n^C\right) = 1-\lim_{N\to\infty} \prod_{n=N}^\infty \pr\left(A_n^C\right) = 1-\lim_{N\to\infty} \prod_{n=N}^\infty (1-\pr\left(A_n\right))$$

Using the relationship between $e^{-x} \geq 1 - x$, we have:

$$1-\lim_{N\to\infty} \prod_{n=N}^\infty (1-\pr\left(A_n\right)) \geq 1-\lim_{N\to\infty} e^{-\sum_{n=N}^\infty \pr\left(A_n\right)} \to 1$$

as $\sum \pr(A\_n) = \infty$. So $\pr(\limsup A\_n^C) \geq 1$ thus $\pr(\limsup A\_n) = 1$. $\tag*{∎}$ 

These Borel-Cantelli lemmas, abbreviated as BC lemma 1 (and 2) are critical in understanding convergence concepts in probability. BC lemma provides a relationship between the convergence rate of a sequence of measures $\pr(A\_n)$ and the limiting measure of the sequence. From a previous exercise, we saw that $\liminf A\_n \subseteq \limsup A\_n$ which means

$$\pr\left( \liminf_{n\to\infty} A_n \right) \leq \pr\left(\limsup_{n\to\infty} A_n\right)$$

So if $\pr(\limsup A\_n) = 0$ then it implies $\pr(\liminf A\_n) = 0$. On the other hand, if $\pr(\liminf A\_n) = 1$ then it implies $\pr(\limsup A\_n) = 1$. From a similar previous exercise, we saw that $\liminf A\_n^C = \limsup A\_n$ so if $pr(\limsup A\_n^C) = 0$ (perhaps we may run into this situation after invoking the BC lemma), then it implies $\pr(\liminf A\_n) = 1$. This in turn implies $\pr(\limsup A\_n) = 1$. 

If $A\_1,...,A\_n,...$ are an independent sequence, then the Borel Cantelli lemmas form an if and only if statement, that is, we also know that when $\pr(\limsup A\_n) = 1$ implies the probability sums diverge. The analogous statement can be made for BC lemma 1. 

## Applications of Borel-Cantelli Lemmas

There are several applications of Borel-Cantelli. Several are detailed in Durrett or Billingsley. Below are a few, to provide examples of how the BC lemmas are invoked. 

### Coin flipping 

Suppose we flip a coin infinitely many times, with probability $p$ of landing heads at each flip and each flip is independent of the other flips. What should the probability be - of flipping a sequence of 3 heads, infinitely often?

Step 0, we define $A\_n$ to be a sequence of 3 heads beginning at flip $n$. So $\pr(\limsup\_n A\_n)$ denotes the probability of flipping a sequence of 3 heads infinitely often.

Step 1, we acknowledge that $A_k$ and$A_{k+1}$ are dependent events. However we note that at a sequence of 3 beginning flip $k$ and a sequence beginning on flip $k+3$ are independent. Thus we section our entire chain at every 3 flips and index each section with set $B\_m$. That is $B\_m = A_{3k-2}$ starting with $k=1,...$.

Step 2, we recognize that each $B_m$ has a chance of $p^3$ to be a sequence of 3 heads. Furthermore, $B_m$ occuring infinitely often (wrt $m$) means $A_n$ occurs infinitely often (wrt $n$). That is, $\limsup\_m B\_m \subseteq \limsup\_n A_n$. Thus if $\pr(\limsup B\_m) = 1$ then $\pr(\limsup A\_n)$ must be 1.

Step 3, we apply Borel Cantelli lemma 2 to show $\pr(\limsup B\_m) = 1$. This is justified, since $\sum \pr(B\_m) = \sum p^3 = \infty$. Therefore we also know $\pr(\limsup A\_n) = 1$. This means we can flip a sequence of 3 heads infinitely often, with probability 1.

This result hints at something more philosophical. This result suggests at the concept of probability being lumpy. This means that in a truly random result, we should see several chains of the same outcome (in this case, heads). While a chain $H,T,H,T,H.H,T,T,H$ alternating may look random to a human, it is more often going to look like $H,H,H,H,H,T,T,H,H$ where we see occurences of chains. Note this proof for coin flipping will work for any finite sequence length. The result is the same if the problem was changed to "rolling a sequence of 1000 tens infinitely often using a 1000-faced-die." The probability of this happening (infinitely often) is 1. Perhaps with a naive intuition, the chance of rolling a sequence of 1000 tens where the probability of rolling a ten is 0.001, is incredibly unlikely. But when we are talking about something happening infinitely often, ad infinitum, this result provides perspective on how large infinity truly is, where something as unlikely as rolling the long chain of tens, becomes almost certain.

To realize how remarkable this result is, it is critical to understand what we are talking about when we use this coin flipping example. 

The probability space of infinite coin flips is any permutation of a repeating sequence of $\\{H,T\\}$. That is, each element of $\Omega$ is an infinitely long chain of $H$ and $T$'s. The number of chains is $2^\nats$ which is an uncountable set. Yet the result of the Borel-Cantelli lemma tells us that almost all the chains will contain the chain of heads, and the chain of heads will occur infinitely often. Only a small number of sequences will contain finitely many chains of heads. In fact, this small number is so small, that it has measure of exactly 0 in relation to the size of $\Omega$. 

### Proving Limit Supremum of a Random Variable

We will prove that $\limsup X\_n/\log n = 1$ almost surely, where $X\_n \sim Exp(1)$ and are all iid therefore $\pr(X\_n > k) = e^{-k}$. To prove this, we should hope that $\limsup X\_n/\log n > 1-\eps$ happens with probability 1, and $\liminf X\_n /\log n < 1+\eps$ happens with probability 1. That is, the sequence $X\_n/\log n$ must be arbitrarily close to 1, infinitely often, and the sequence $X\_n/\log n$ must be arbitarily close to 1 in eventuality.

So, to evaulate $\pr(\limsup X\_n > (1-\eps)\log n)$, we can use Borel-Cantelli. $\pr(X\_n > (1-\eps)\log n) = e^{-(1-\eps)\log n} = \frac{1}{n^{1-\eps}}$. This sequence over $n$ is divergent, so $\pr(\limsup X\_n > (1-\eps)\log n) = 1$ by Borel-Cantelli. This holds for all $\eps > 0$.

To evaluate $\pr(\liminf X\_n < (1+\eps) \log n)$, we can consider the complement $1-\pr(\limsup X\_n > (1+\eps) \log n)$. So if we examine $\pr(X\_n \geq (1+\eps)\log n)$, by the same argument as above, we will be summing $\sum \frac{1}{n^{1+\eps}}$ which is convergent as it is a harmonic series with $n^{-p}$ where $p>1$. So $\pr(\limsup X\_n \geq (1+\eps) \log n) = 0$ thus $\pr(\liminf X\_n < (1+\eps) \log n) = 1$. This is true for all $\eps > 0$. 

We will now need to evaluate the following:

$$\bigcap_{\eps > 0} \left[\limsup X_n > (1-\eps)\log n \right] \cap \left[ \liminf X_n < (1+\eps) \log n \right]$$

However, $\eps > 0$ is an uncountable set, so we can rewrite this to take intersections over a countable index:

$$\bigcap_{k \in \nats} \left[\limsup X_n > \left(1-\frac{1}{k}\right)\log n \right] \cap \left[ \liminf X_n < \left(1+\frac{1}{k}\right) \log n \right]$$

The probability of the set above is 1, thus we have the required conditions needed to show $\limsup X\_n/\log n = 1$ with probabilty 1.  

### Proving Convergence Almost Surely

Proving convergence almost surely is on of the more signficant tasks in statstics, as the strong law of large numbers involves almost sure convergence. The following is an example of almost sure convergence, proven with the Borel-Cantelli lemma mechanism.

Let $\pr(X\_n = 1) = 1/n^2$ and $\pr(X\_n = 0) = 1-1/n^2$ for independent $X\_n$. We should expect $X\_n$ converges almost surely to 0. First, $\pr(X\_n = 1) = 1/n^2$ so summing over $n$ produces a convergent sum. Thus $\limsup X\_n = 1$ happens with probability 0. But if we examine $\pr(X\_n = 0) = 1-1/n^2$, this produces a divergent sum, so $X\_n = 0$ infinitely often happens with probability 1. 

To converge almost surely, we need to show that the random variable has the same limit superior and limit inferior. So if we check that $\liminf X\_n = 0$ happens with probability 1 as well, then $\lim X\_n = 0$ with probability 1. To check $\liminf X\_n = 0$ with probability 1, we check its complement $\limsup X\_n = 1$ which we determined has probability 0 from above. So $\liminf X\_n = 0$ happens with probabilty 1. 

Thus $\lim X\_n = 0$ with probability 1 so we say $X\_n$ converges to 0 almost surely.  

**Note on Exercises on Borel-Cantelli**: There are several key exercises that will enhance understanding of Borel-Cantelli lemmas. I highly recommend working through examples and exercises from Durrett Chapter 2.3. A few critical exercises are listed below as well:

**Exercise**: Let $\\{A\_n\\}_{n\geq 1}$ be a sequence of independent events. Prove $\pr(\cup A\_n) = 1$ if and only if $\sum \pr(A\_n) = \infty$ aka $\pr(A\_n \text{ i.o.}) = 1$. (Hint: One direction is trivial. For the other direction, leverage the fact that events are independent.)

**Exercise**: Let $X\_1,...,X\_n,...$ be independent random variables. Show that $\sup X\_n < \infty$ almost surely if and only if $\sum \pr(X\_n > M) < \infty$ for some $M$. (Hint: For one direction, the contrapositive may be easier to prove.)

**Exercise**: Let $X\_n$ be iid with $X\_n = 1$ with probability $\frac{1}{n^2}$ and $X\_n = 0$ with probability $1-\frac{1}{n^2}$. Show that $\sum_{n=1}^\infty X\_n < \infty$ almost surely.  

Now that we have a technology for discussing measures of limiting events, we are now ready to talk about expectation and integration, in particular regarding their limiting properties.
