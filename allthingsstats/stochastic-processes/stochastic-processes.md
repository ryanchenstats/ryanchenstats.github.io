Stochastic processes are random processes represented as a sequence of random variables. While in probability theory, a main concern of studying sequences of random variables is their limiting behavior, stochastic processes are studied in hopes of using them to model processes that occur in reality. Some examples of stochastic processes are weather patterns, stock prices, population models, and queueing lines, etc. The aim of studying stochastic processes is to develop some theories that can help us understand these phenomena. Additionally, in mathematics, differential equations are frequently used to model phenomena in the real world, as such in the work of physicists and chemists. When the inputs to the differential equations are no longer deterministic, but rather, *stochastic*, the theory of stochastic differential equations becomes important. 

The aim of these notes is to provide some basic theories used to develop tools that can help model real-world phenomena. To this end, these notes will be slightly less theoretical and geared towards applications, but will provide some rigor in understanding the essentials of stochastic processes.
