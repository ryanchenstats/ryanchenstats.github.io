The goal of this page is two-fold. First, throughout my statistical education, I found several courses to be foundational in my understanding of statistical theory. Writing and maintaining these pages help me stay refreshed on these topics. Second, during my time learning these topics, I valued a high level overview of these complex topics to be useful. However the devil lies in the details, and a high-level overview is quite useless if important details are overlooked. Without omitting too many details in the overview, I hope my exposition can serve as a good launchpad for those beginning to embark on their statistical education. As a preface, mathematical exposure in multivariate calculus, linear algebra, and real analysis are assumed. Furthermore, it is expected that the reader has been exposed to calculus-based probability and calculus-based inference.

Topics that will be discussed are

* **Mathematical Statistics**: provides an introductory understanding to several statistical concepts such as distribution function, expectations, transformations, and order statistics [calculus]
* **Statistical Inference**: provides rigor in the theory of estimation and hypothesis testing, both asymptotic and non-asymptotic [calculus, mathematical statistics]
* **Linear Regression**: provides a geometrical view of regression [linear algebra, calculus, mathematical statistics]
* **Probability Theory**: provide rigor and justifications to several asymptotic statements made in statistics such as the law of large numbers and central limit theorem [real analysis, calculus, mathematical statistics]
* **Stochastic Processes**: provide an introduction to basic stochastic processes, such as Markov chains, martingales, and brownian motion as well as stochastic calculus. [real analysis, calculus, mathematical statistics, probability theory]

The topics surrounded by brackets are the topics in which I assume the reader is familiar. Other topics will be discussed if there is interest.
