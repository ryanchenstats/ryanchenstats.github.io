Probability theory was not formalized until [A.N. Kolmogorov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrey_Kolmogorov), a Soviet mathematician, set out to view probability as a measure - and this viewpoint drew upon the work of [Henri Lebesgue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Lebesgue) who generalized the field of measure theory via integration. From calculus-based probability, we saw that a probability was either a sum or an integral over the density or mass function, and at the time of studying it, we did not necessarily need to connect the ideas of "measure" and "integration" together, but in order to better understand properties of probability, it is crucial to visit measure theory and to view probability as a measure. To this end, we will develop some rigor in understanding measure theory.

Additionally, one of the core motivations for studying measure theoretic probability is to understand the concept of limits and infinities - which is where analysis comes into play. An outcome space with a finite number of outcomes is easy to analyze, and we are able to enumerate each event with a probability. However in the case of infinite outcome spaces or even uncountable outcome spaces, this is no longer so simple. Throughout the study of measure theoretic probability, it is critical to understand the notion of what it truly means when considering the "limit."

With respect to the content of these notes, it will follow closely to Durrett's ["Probability: Theory and Examples"](https://www.amazon.com/Probability-Cambridge-Statistical-Probabilistic-Mathematics/dp/0521765390) and Patrick Billingsley's ["Probability and Measure"](https://www.amazon.com/Probability-Measure-Patrick-Billingsley/dp/1118122372). The aim of these notes is to provide an abridged version of measure theoretic probability, such that it still presents key ideas without delving deep into theoreticals. The expectation is that the reader will supplement the notes with the texts mentioned above. Key exercises are also presented as a way for the reader to engage with the fundamental concepts of the material and are drawn from the texts above. The exercises have no solutions posted but many of these exercises have been answered on various online forums. 

My personal expectation regarding the diffuculty level as presented in the notes is that it is reasonable for an advanced undergraduate, or early graduate student in math, statistics, or related fields, to grasp as an introduction to measure theoretic probability.
