# Prelude on Sets

A set is nothing but a collection of objects. In probability theory, often times we refer to sets of events. Furthermore, sets in probability theory, much like other branches of math, are usually constructed in a way such that the types of objects within the sets are well defined. Taking an example from analysis, $X = \\{x \in \mathbb{R} : x^2 < 2\\}$, the set $X$ is precisely all real numbers who square is less than 2. Each object inside $X$ must be between $-\sqrt{2}$ and $\sqrt{2}$ and cannot be exactly $\pm \sqrt{2}$. In a sense, sets define a logical structure endowed upon all points within the set.

In a more advanced manner, we can consider the set of all open intervals in $\mathbb{R}$. In written form, $B := \\{(a,b) : -\infty \leq a < b \leq \infty\\}$. Every point in the set $\mathcal{B}$ is an _interval_ (not a number). (The $\sigma$-algebra generated by this set $\mathcal{B} = \sigma(B)$ is called the _Borel algebra_ on the real numbers - more on this later.) For now, the key takeaway is that where a set is defined, then a logic is defined.

# Motivation for Sigma-Algebras and Measurability

In probability, one fundamental object of interest is the **outcome space** denoted by $\Omega$. This is the set of all possible observable outcomes. Any subset of $\Omega$ is called an **event** For example, in flipping a coin twice, the outcome space is

$$\Omega := \{HH,HT,TH,TT\}$$

This is a countable set of events, and in their entirety, forms the outcome space $\Omega$. Here $\Omega$ has a cardinality of 4, and it is a finite outcome space. Things are easy to calculate here. For example $\mathbb{P}(\text{at least one head}) = \frac{\\|\\{HH,HT,TH\\}\\|}{\\|\Omega\\|} = 3/4$.

In the example above, the outcome space is finite, and all possible subsets of the outcome space is enumerable and we can assign probabilities to each event in $2^\Omega$. However in an infinite outcome space, it is no longer possible to enumerate all the events with probabilities. Instead, we focus our attention to subsets of "interest." In this context, a set is interesting if these sets a probability assigned to it and we wish to evaluate the probability. In any outcome space we would be interested in events as enumerated below:

1. The empty set, which has probability of 0
2. For a given event, the complement of the event should also be of interest
3. For any given set of events, their unions should be also of interest

These three qualities completely define all sets that are of interest to us. Of course, you might wonder, what about set intersections, using the coin flipping example, we might be interested in the quantity $\\{HH,HT,TH\\} \cap \\{HT, HT, TT\\}$. Namely, this is the intersection of the event where we get at least one head, and the event where we get at least one tail. The intersection of these two events is $\\{HT, TH\\}$, which is clearly a set of interest, and it has probability $1/2$. Surprisingly, this set intersection example is already covered by the 3 qualities of "interesting" events.

These three charactersitics of "interesting events" forms a logical structure called the $\sigma$-algebra. A $\sigma$-algebra of events in $\Omega$ is simply the power set $2^\Omega$ which has 16 elements in it. Now if we consider the outcome space of rolling a six-sided die, the $\sigma$-algebra of events is again the power set of $2^{\\{1,...,6\\}}$ which has $2^6 = 64$ elements. Now lets make the game more complicated, and suppose the computer rolls the dice for us, and it will not tell us the result of the roll. Instead, it will check if the number is 1 or 2 in which it will tell us 'A'. If the roll was a 3 or 4, the computer will tell us 'B'. And finally if the roll was a 5 or 6, the computer will tell us 'C'. So we never observe any numbers, and we only observe the resulting 'A', 'B', or 'C'. Our $\sigma$-algebra will look like: 

$$\Omega := \{\emptyset, \{1,2\}, \{3,4\}, \{5,6\}, \{1,2,3,4\}, \{3,4,5,6\}, \{1,2,5,6\}, \{1,2,3,4,5,6\} \}$$

Taking points 1, 2, and 3 above, we can translate the characteristics of an interesting set into mathematics. So the $\sigma$-algebra (for our purposes, this is also a $\sigma$-field or $\sigma$-ring) defined on $\Omega$ is the collection of events $\mathcal{F}$ such that

1. $\emptyset \in \mathcal{F}$
2. If $A \in \mathcal{F}$ then $A^C \in \mathcal{F}$
3. For any countable (need not be finite) sequence of sets $A_1,...,A_n,...\in \mathcal{F}$, then $\cup_{i=1}^\infty A_i \in \mathcal{F}$

At this point, we should reflect back on the prelude to set theory. A $\sigma$-algebra really is a logical structure, defining what it means to be a set of "interest." Specifically, given any set of elements in $\mathcal{F}$ we know their complements are also in $\mathcal{F}$, and their unions are also in $\mathcal{F}$.

**Exercise**: Show that countable intersections are closed under $\mathcal{F}$, i.e. if $A_1,...,A_n,...$ then $\cap_{i=1}^\infty A_i \in \mathcal{F}$ (Hint: use De Morgan's Laws).
**Exercise**: Write the $\sigma$-algebra of the outcome space of flipping two coins. (Hint: There should be 16 elements in the resulting sigma algebra.)

Note in the outcome space of a dice roll, depending on how we as observers will record outcomes, i.e. recording $\\{1,2\\}$ as the same event (in the previous example, this would be the event of observing 'A') or recording $\\{1\\}, \\{2\\}$ as two seperate events, the $\sigma$-algebras will be of different size. This is clear, since above, we noted that the $\sigma$-algebra "generated" on $\\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}$ would have a cardinality of 64, while the $\sigma$-algebra "generated" on $\\{\\{1,2\\},\\{3,4\\},\\{5,6\\}\\}$ has a cardinality of 8. $\sigma$-algebras can be viewed in relation to each other, and it would convey the idea of "level of information." Denote $\mathcal{A}_1 = \sigma(\\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\})$ to be the $\sigma$-algebra "generated" by $\\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}$. Denote also $\mathcal{A}_2 = \sigma(\\{\\{1,2\\},\\{3,4\\},\\{5,6\\}\\})$ to be the $\sigma$-algebra "generated" by $\\{\\{1,2\\},\\{3,4\\},\\{5,6\\}\\}$.

**Exercise**: Show that $\mathcal{A}_1 \supseteq \mathcal{A}_2$. (Hint: Both are $\sigma$-algebras, and it suffices to show all elements in $\mathcal{A}_2$ are in $\mathcal{A}_1$. To be thorough, find an element that is in $\mathcal{A}_2$ but not in $\mathcal{A}_1$).

If you were successful in the exercise above, then you have shown that one $\sigma$-algebra is "smaller" than the other. Essentially, the scenario that produced the collection of sets of interest, $\mathcal{A}_2$, yields less information to you as an observer about your data generating process, when compared to the information from the scenario producing $\mathcal{A}_1$. That is, an observer in the scenario producing $\mathcal{A}_1$ will have interest in all events in $\mathcal{A}_2$ but an observer in the scenario producing $\mathcal{A}_2$ will not be able to even know of the existence of some events in $\mathcal{A}_1$. 

To tie this back into measure theory, if we have a quantity of interest, we can measure it. It we do not know if a set even exists, we cannot measure it. Namely, in the scenario producing $\mathcal{A}_2$, the set $\\{1\\}$ does not exist in $\mathcal{A}_2$, so $\\{1\\}$ is not $\mathcal{A}_2$-measurable. But of course, it is $\mathcal{A}_1$-measurable. 

### Generation of Sigma-Algebras

By now, you should have noticed that I used the term "generated" in quotes. Generation has a specific meaning when it comes to set theory, and a $\sigma$-algebra generated by some set $X$ is defined as the following: 

**Sigma-Algebra generation**
> For all $\sigma$-algebras that contain $X$, denoted as $\cv{F}_n$ for all indexing $n$, 
> $\sigma(X) = \cap_{i\in \nats} \cv{F}_n$.


### Algebras and Semi-Algebras

The notion of a $\sigma$-algebra is rather strong in that all countably infinite sequences of sets must be closed in the $\sigma$-algebra. Sometimes, this is not possible.
