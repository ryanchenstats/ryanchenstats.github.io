# Motivation for Sigma-Algebras

In probability, one fundamental object of interest is the outcome space denoted by $\Omega$. This is the set of all possible observable outcomes. For example, in flipping a coin twice, the outcome space is
$$\{HH,HT,TH,TT\}$$

This is a countable set of events, and in their entirity, forms the outcome space $\Omega$. Here $\Omega$ has a cardinality of 4, and it is a finite outcome space.
